## Properties

The objective of this project is to reimplement containers from the stl cpp. 

On this project I have to take care of ``vector``, ``stack``, ``map`` and ``set``.
For the map and set storage method I used a [red black tree](https://github.com/tsannie/red_black_tree) that I modified a bit to adapt it to the containers request.

Each container has its own ``test files`` with a ``Makefile``.
At the end of the Makefile 2 binaries are created execute and compare with the cpp containers. A ``time comparison`` is also performed
